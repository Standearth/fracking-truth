            <!-- <p>While gas companies push their products on us, we have a more modern, clean, and affordable technology to heat our homes: electric heat pumps!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat pumps are 300% more efficient than gas furnaces and use electricity as an input, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions </li>
                <li>For these reasons, heat pumps also lead to lower monthly energy bills for residents  </li>
                <li>Heat pumps offer stable monthly energy costs (unlike furnaces that depend on volatile gas prices) </li>
                <li>Heat pumps double as air conditioners in the summer </li>
                <li>Heat pumps have an air purifying function </li>
                <li>Advancements in heat pump technology mean they can now heat homes in the coldest of temperatures, including in northern Canada </li>
                <li>Installing heat pumps at the construction stage means homes can be built faster and at a lower cost than using gas furnaces which require expensive pipelines and gas hookups</li>
                <li>Equipping homes with heat pumps from the beginning means skipping the cost of retrofits in the future</li>
                <li>Unlike gas equipment, heat pumps don’t emit poisonous chemicals </li>
            </ul>-->
