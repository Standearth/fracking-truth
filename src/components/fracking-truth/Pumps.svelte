                <p>While gas companies push their products on us, we have a more modern, clean, and affordable technology to heat our homes: electric heat pumps!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat pumps are 300% more efficient than gas furnaces and use electricity as an input, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions </li>
                    <li>For these reasons, heat pumps also lead to lower monthly energy bills for residents  </li>
                    <li>Heat pumps offer stable monthly energy costs (unlike furnaces that depend on volatile gas prices) </li>
                    <li>Heat pumps double as air conditioners in the summer </li>
                    <li>Heat pumps have an air purifying function </li>
                    <li>Advancements in heat pump technology mean they can now heat homes in the coldest of temperatures, including in northern Canada </li>
                    <li>Installing heat pumps at the construction stage means homes can be built faster and at a lower cost than using gas furnaces which require expensive pipelines and gas hookups</li>
                    <li>Equipping homes with heat pumps from the beginning means skipping the cost of retrofits in the future</li>
                    <li>Unlike gas equipment, heat pumps donâ€™t emit poisonous chemicals </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Heat pumps are a win-win-win for the climate, our wallets, and public health.</p>               
                <p><strong>There is misinformation out there - because the gas industry wants to keep selling its harmful product. </strong></p>
